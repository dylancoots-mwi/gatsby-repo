Join us in a live virtual Q&A with Sebastian Ramirez, founder of FastAPI, and Salma Alam-Naylor, DevRel Advocate at Sentry.

As a follow-up to our first-ever FastAPI meetup in Berlin, this virtual event will answer all of the questions we didn’t get a chance to during the meetup, and also allows anyone to pick Sebastian’s brain in this rare opportunity.

Come ready to chat and we hope to see you there.
