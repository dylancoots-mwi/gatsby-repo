We get a lot of questions from mobile developers about the difference between Sentry and Firebase Crashlytics, a lightweight crash reporting tool. In this live workshop, we will dive into the details you need to know to make an informed decision. Join Sentry product manager Zoe Chou and Developer Advocate Lazar Nikolov to see:

* A side-by-side product comparison between Sentry and Crashlytics
* Why Sentryâ€™s product philosophy sets it apart
* How Sentry can help your team increase your crash-free rate and solve errors, faster

We will also hear from an experienced mobile developer, Oscar Bernal, founder of Spin Tennis App, who will share why he chose Sentry after using both tools.
